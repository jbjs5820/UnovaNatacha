# Project Evaluation - Academic Project Management Application

## Current State Analysis

This document evaluates the current state of the Academic Project Management Application and provides recommendations for implementing the requested functionality.

## Project Requirements

Based on the user's requirements, the application should:

1. **Project Builder**:
   - Allow users to create projects with title, objectives, target users, deadlines, etc.
   - The current project builder functionality is working but lacks AI integration.

2. **Task Management**:
   - AI should automatically attribute tasks to users based on project information.
   - Tasks should include gathering papers, using existing resources, and creating new resources.
   - Current implementation has basic task management but lacks AI-driven task creation.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Resources should be stored in a Supabase Bucket for each project.
   - Current implementation has local resource storage but lacks proper Supabase integration.

4. **Export Functionality**:
   - When tasks are completed, AI should produce a complete document.
   - Export options should include JSON, Word, and PDF formats.
   - Current implementation has JSON and PDF export but lacks Word export.

5. **AI Integration**:
   - The application should use AI to assist in all aspects of project management.
   - The AIAssistantView component exists but needs better integration with projects and tasks.

## Analysis of Current Components

### Project Management
- Projects can be created, edited, and deleted.
- Project information is stored locally (localStorage).
- Supabase integration exists but is not fully utilized for project data.

### Task Management
- Tasks can be created, edited, and deleted.
- Task information is stored locally (localStorage).
- Supabase schema for tasks exists but is not fully utilized.
- No AI-driven task creation based on project information.

### Resource Management
- Resources can be added from paper searches.
- Resource information is stored locally (localStorage).
- Supabase integration for storing resources in buckets is incomplete.

### AI Integration
- AI Assistant View has multiple tabs:
  - Paper Search: Allows searching for academic papers (functional)
  - Content Generation: Allows generating academic content (functional)
  - Text Analysis: For analyzing text (implementation incomplete)
  - AI History: For tracking AI interactions (implementation incomplete)
- Not fully integrated with project and task management.

### Export Functionality
- JSON export is functional.
- PDF export is functional.
- Word export is missing.

## Required Implementations

To meet the requirements, the following implementations are needed:

1. **AI Project Task Generation**:
   - Create a function that generates tasks based on project information.
   - Integrate with the project creation workflow.
   - Automatically assign tasks to users.

2. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Implement proper Supabase CRUD operations for projects, tasks, and resources.
   - Set up Supabase Bucket storage for resources.
   - Migrate from localStorage to Supabase for persistent storage.

3. **Document Export Enhancement**:
   - Add Word export functionality.
   - Improve PDF export with more structured formatting.
   - Add AI-generated summaries to exports.

4. **AI Integration Enhancement**:
   - Integrate AI suggestions into project and task workflows.
   - Implement AI-driven task assignment.
   - Add automated resource suggestions based on project context.

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Fix Current Issues**:
   - Resolve the pencil icon functionality issue.

2. **AI Task Generation**:
   - Implement AI-driven task creation based on project information.

3. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Complete the Supabase integration for all data types.

4. **Enhanced Export**:
   - Add Word document export functionality.

5. **Full AI Integration**:
   - Connect all components with AI-driven workflows.

## Technical Debt and Considerations

1. **Code Structure**:
   - The application uses React with a component-based architecture.
   - Components are well-organized but could benefit from more modular design.

2. **Data Management**:
   - Currently relies heavily on localStorage which is not scalable.
   - Supabase integration is partially implemented but not fully utilized.

3. **AI Integration**:
   - Uses Gemini API for AI functionality.
   - Integration with project management needs improvement.

4. **UI/UX**:
   - The UI is functional but could benefit from more interactive elements.
   - Mobile responsiveness should be tested.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Supabase integration for projects, tasks, and resources.
2. Implement AI-driven task generation based on project information.
3. Add Word export functionality.
4. Enhance AI integration throughout the application.
5. Create comprehensive documentation for users.
